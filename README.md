**Slider_GUI_Python,Rotation Property of Fourier Transform**

**TASK (For Code 1) :**

Write a Matlab/Python script to compute the discrete-space Fourier transformof 
the 2-D sequence f[k;m] = cos( ω0 (k cosθ + m sinθ) ); 1≤k;m≤256 :The variableω0takes values between 0 and π, and θ takes values between 
0 and 2π.  Incorporate a linear slider to select the value of ω0 and a slider to select the value of θ. 
Each slider must accommodate at least 120 values in the given range.  Display your results on three panels side-by-side: 
the first panelfor showing the 2-D sequencef, the second one for the Fourier magnitude, andthe third one for the Fourier phase. For each figure, display the titles as well (APLANE WAVE, FOURIER MAGNITUDE, FOURIER PHASE, as the casemay be, in UPPERCASE). Also display the values ofωandθin the legend ofthe first panel.
All the figure panels must get dynamically updated dependingon the choice of ω and θ.
